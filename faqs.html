                        <p>While some cancers have a strong hereditary component, most are caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.
                            Genetic counseling and testing can help individuals understand their inherited risk factors for certain cancers.
                            Screening and preventive measures, such as increased surveillance or prophylactic surgery, may be recommended for individuals with a high genetic risk of cancer.
                            It's essential to discuss genetic testing and its implications with a healthcare professional who specializes in cancer genetics.</p>
